In the era of internet and technology, every aspect of life would be supported to make work easier. One of the outstanding technology which facilitates human life is IoT. Being inspired by this concept, I've decided to create an application called “Home Smart Assistant”. The application helps to keep track of the environment inside my house by communicating with an Arduino board which control temperature sensors, flame detector sensor and gas sensors. Basically, the app will display the temperature inside the house, show a warning when the level of flammable gases is high and when it detects fire. Besides, users could control the app by voice, giving commands to the app to communicate with Arduino.

The application will provide the features as below:
- Controlling by voice. For example, users could say “What is the temperature now?”
and then the app will communicate with Arduino board to return the temperature and
show it to users in the UI.
- Show a warning when detecting fire or dangerous gases.
- Support calling emergency from users command.
- Managing user account (log in and sign in)
